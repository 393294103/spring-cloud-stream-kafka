Sandbox repository to get an intro into event driven microservices with [Spring Cloud Stream](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/) and [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/)

Kafka [powers many large production systems] (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Powered+By) and it is gaining also territory into [event sourcing](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#uses_eventsourcing) so definetely worth to give it a spin.

Technology stack:
* [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/): create uber-jarâ€”self-runnable and autonomous data microservice application with an embedded application container
* [Spring Cloud Stream](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/): build message-driven microservices
* [Spring Integration](https://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/): provide connectivity to message brokers
* [Apache Kafka] (http://kafka.apache.org/): message broker responsible for distributing the events
